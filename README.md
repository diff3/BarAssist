# BarAssist

The first goal with this addon is to create an popup menu similar to the popup menu in MacOS, the other goal is to make it very simplicity but yet powerful. I don't want to have tons of menu's to configure, instead I'll try to integrate configuration mode into the menu itself. To create a seamless experience.

I have use DagAssist for years, and then the addon stopped to work then Mist of Pandaria was released, I backwards engineered it so I could fix what was broken. It's a very well written addon, but some soluties broke then World of Warcraft evolved. The name BarAssist is a salute to DagAssist.

My last goal, to become a better programmer by learning and try to push my programming skills. I have tried to use every smart techich I have learnt over the years but also to comment the code so others can use this addon as a base to write something own.
